# Conclusion

## important or surprising moments 
- qsort on median of medians works assimptotically faster but in reality it is not faster in many cases (because of a large constant multiplier in work_time)
- quadratic time working sorts has some differences in processing time: bubble > insert > select 
- lsd sort is noticeably faster than merge sort

## new knowledge 
- repeat writing recently studied lsd sort
- get acquinted with pyplot library
